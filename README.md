# TF Binding Sites Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting transcription factor (TF) binding sites using DNA sequence data. The dataset is sourced from *ENCODE*, and the goal is to classify DNA sequences into binding or non-binding sites. The project employs deep learning, traditional machine learning models, and state-of-the-art techniques to compare their effectiveness.

## Methodology
1. *Data Preprocessing*
   - One-hot encoding or k-mer encoding of DNA sequences.
   
2. *Model Development*
   - Custom *CNN model* optimized using *Keras Tuner*.
   - Comparison with *traditional ML models* (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression).
   - Evaluation against *state-of-the-art models* for TF binding site prediction.
   
3. *Deployment*
   - Hosting the best-performing model on *Streamlit* for real-time predictions.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshGujarathi7/Master-s-Capstone-Project.git
cd tf-binding-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Train and evaluate models:

bash
python train.py


Run the Streamlit app:

bash
streamlit run app.py


## Features
- Supports *multiple encoding schemes* (One-hot, k-mer)
- Custom *CNN architecture* optimized with *Keras Tuner*
- *Traditional ML models* for comparison
- *State-of-the-art model evaluation*
- *Streamlit web interface* for easy interaction

## Roadmap
- [ ] Fine-tune CNN architecture
- [ ] Experiment with additional encoding techniques
- [ ] Enhance Streamlit UI with visualizations
- [ ] Deploy on cloud (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces, AWS, GCP)
